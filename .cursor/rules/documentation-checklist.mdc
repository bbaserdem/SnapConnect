# Checklist

## Goal

To track progress towards goals of each phase, and document the workflow.

## Checklist conventions

There will be one checklist per phase, named `<N>-checklist.md`.
Each checklist of a phase consists of headers from the tasks of the corresponding phase.
Whenever a major action towards a subtask is done by the code assistant,
the code assistant should put a corresponding entry under the task header.
This would look like the following;

```/_docs/checklist/1-mdp.md
## Task 1
- [ ] Subtask 1
- [ ] Subtask 2
- [ ] Subtask 3
```

Radio buttons should be marked as done `[x]` when finished.
## Process

1.  Read current phase list from the corresponding md file.
2.  Break the tasks and subtasks into actionable items
3.  Mark them as done as you move down the list.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the PRD is a **junior developer**.
Therefore, requirements should be explicit, unambiguous, and avoid jargon where possible.
Provide enough detail for them to understand the feature's purpose and core logic.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/_docs/checklist`
*   **Filename:** `<N>-<feature>.md`

## Final instructions

1. Do NOT change the checklist documents after generation, unless prompted specifically by the developer.
