# NixOS

## Overview
Make sure we can develop on NixOS, and still have our project run elsewhere.
We will be using flakes, and the current shell will have direnv to automatically load our dev shell.

## Guidelines for writing to flake.nix
1. inputs.nixpkgs should point to the unstable branch of nixpkgs.
2. Use flake-utils to make flake.nix more readable
3. Keep our flake as a hybrid model; prefer to fetch packages using the tech stack package manager whenever you can.
4. Avoid shell hooks that have output to avoid clutter when entering a dev shell.
5. Keep all nix files, except `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`, in a directory named `nix` to reduce clutter.

## Guidelines for picking tech stack
- Don't suggest packages and software that is known to be incompatible with NixOS.
- State when a software I want to use is incompatible developing with NixOS.
