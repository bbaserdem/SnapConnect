# Checklist

## Goal

To keep an organized repo README.md and CHANGELOG.md

## Readme conventions

- Readme should state the project, a brief description, and details on how to build the package.
- All build dependencies should be listed, along with their versions, in a table.
- Don't mention nix in the readme, state the required build software and versions.
- Provide a brief summary on the functions of the project

## Changelog conventions

- Each version bump should update the changelog.
- Change log should be a list per version that documents the added features in between the two versions.
