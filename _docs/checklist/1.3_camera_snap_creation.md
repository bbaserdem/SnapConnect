- **Flash not working**: Verify device has flash capability and permissions

### **Navigation Issues:**
- **Edit screen blank**: May indicate media capture or file system issues
- **App crashes on capture**: Check console for detailed error messages
- **Back navigation broken**: Verify router configuration and state management

### **Text Overlay Issues:**
