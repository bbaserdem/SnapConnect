## üêõ **Common Issues & Troubleshooting**

### **Performance Issues:**
- **Choppy camera preview**: Expected if using emulator with real webcam due to virtualization overhead
- **Slow capture**: May indicate insufficient device resources or storage issues

### **Camera Issues:**
- **Black screen**: Usually indicates permission or camera initialization problems
- **Camera not switching**: Check device has both front and back cameras available
- **Flash not working**: Verify device has flash capability and permissions

### **Navigation Issues:**
- **Edit screen blank**: May indicate media capture or file system issues
- **App crashes on capture**: Check console for detailed error messages
- **Back navigation broken**: Verify router configuration and state management

### **Text Overlay Issues:**
- **Text not appearing**: Check keyboard/input system functionality
- **Text positioning problems**: Verify gesture detection and coordinate mapping
- **Color/size not applying**: Check state management and UI update cycles
