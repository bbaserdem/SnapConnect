# SnapConnect

SnapConnect is a social media application for body modification enthusiasts, built with Flutter and Firebase.

## Features

- User authentication with email/password
- Real-time messaging and photo sharing
- Profile customization with interest tags
- Story sharing with 24-hour expiration
- Friend management system

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Firebase project
- For Android development:
  - Android SDK version 35 or higher
  - Android Studio
- For iOS development:
  - Xcode
  - CocoaPods

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snapconnect.git
   cd snapconnect
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Firebase Configuration:
   - Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Enable Cloud Firestore
   - Enable Firebase Storage
   - Enable App Check

4. Add platform-specific Firebase configuration:
   
   For Android:
   - In Firebase Console, register your Android app with package name `com.example.snapconnect`
   - Download `google-services.json`
   - Place it in `android/app/` directory (this file is gitignored)

   For iOS:
   - In Firebase Console, register your iOS app
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - Place it in `ios/Runner/` directory (this file is gitignored)

5. Update Android SDK version:
   - Open `android/app/build.gradle`
   - Set `compileSdk = 35`

## Security Notes

This project follows security best practices:
- Firebase configuration files (`google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`) are not committed to version control
- API keys are restricted to specific services and platforms
- App Check is enabled to prevent unauthorized API access

## Quick Start

### For Development (Recommended)
```bash
direnv allow                              # Load NixOS development environment
emulator-dev -avd snapconnect_emulator   # Start emulator with smooth cameras
flutter run                              # Run the app
```

### For Real Camera Testing
```bash
optimize-webcam                          # Set webcam to emulator-friendly settings
emulator-camera -avd snapconnect_emulator # Start with real webcam (choppy)
flutter run                              # Run the app
restore-webcam                           # Restore webcam for video calls
```

## Development

1. Start an emulator or connect a physical device (see [Testing section](#camera--emulator-testing) for optimized workflows)

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Run unit tests with:
```bash
flutter test
```

### Camera & Emulator Testing

This project includes optimized scripts for different testing scenarios with camera functionality.

#### Prerequisites for NixOS Users
If you're using NixOS, enter the development shell:
```bash
direnv allow  # First time only
# The shell will load automatically with all tools
```

#### Available Testing Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Camera Type | Performance |
|--------|---------|-------------|------------|
| `emulator-dev` | Development & UI testing | Emulated | ‚ö° Excellent |
| `emulator-camera` | Real camera testing | Real webcam | ‚ö†Ô∏è Choppy |
| `setup-physical-device` | Physical device setup | Device camera | üöÄ Native |

#### Webcam Management Scripts

| Script | Resolution | Use Case |
|--------|------------|----------|
| `webcam-minimal` | 320x240 @ 15fps | Emulator testing |
| `optimize-webcam` | 640x480 @ 30fps | Emulator (better quality) |
| `restore-webcam` | 1280x720 @ 30fps | Video calls (recommended) |
| `webcam-ultra` | 1920x1080 @ 30fps | High-quality video calls |

#### Testing Workflows

**1. Development Workflow (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start emulator with smooth emulated cameras
emulator-dev -avd snapconnect_emulator

# Run your Flutter app
flutter run
```

**2. Real Camera Testing Workflow**
```bash
# Optimize webcam for emulator performance
optimize-webcam

# Start emulator with real webcam (choppy but functional)
emulator-camera -avd snapconnect_emulator

# Run your Flutter app
flutter run

# Restore webcam for video calls when done
restore-webcam
```

**3. Physical Device Workflow (Best Performance)**
```bash
# Get setup instructions
setup-physical-device

# Connect your Android phone via USB and run
flutter run
```

#### Camera Features to Test

- [ ] Camera permissions
- [ ] Switch between front/back cameras
- [ ] Take photos
- [ ] Record videos
- [ ] Camera preview performance
- [ ] Filter application
- [ ] Text overlays
- [ ] Story posting with timer

#### Performance Notes

- **Emulated cameras**: Perfect for UI development, filter testing, and general app flow
- **Real webcam in emulator**: Functional but choppy due to QEMU virtualization overhead
- **Physical device**: Best performance for camera-intensive features and real-world testing

#### Troubleshooting

**Camera app crashes:**
- Ensure emulator has cameras configured (`hw.camera.back = emulated`)
- Kill and restart emulator after configuration changes

**Choppy camera performance:**
- Use emulated cameras for development
- Switch to physical device for performance-critical testing
- Use minimal webcam settings with `webcam-minimal`

**Build issues:**
- Verify Android SDK 35 is installed
- Check `compileSdk = 35` in `android/app/build.gradle`
- Ensure Flutter and dependencies are up to date
